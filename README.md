# Task1-Data Visualization
## 🇮🇳 Gender Population Analysis of India (2019–2023)

## 📌 Objective
This project visualizes the gender distribution in India from 2019 to 2023 using publicly available World Bank data.
## 📌 Process
### 1. Data Source Selection
Extracted gender-wise population data of India from the World Bank – World Development Indicators.
### 2. Indicators Chosen
Population,female (SP.POP.TOTL.FE.IN)
Population, male (SP.POP.TOTL.MA.IN)
### 3. Time Period
Data from the years 2014-23 was selected.
### 4. Data Cleaning
Filtered data to include only India and selected years.
Transformed dataset using pandas to align years as rows and genders as columns.
### 5. Data Visualization
Plotted a grouped bar chart using matplotlib.
X-axis: Years (2019–2023)
Y-axis: Total male population & Total Female population 
## 📈 Key Findings

1. The male population in India was consistently higher than the female population across all four years.
2. Both male and female populations showed a steady increase from 2019 to 2023.
3. The gap between male and female population remains significant but relatively constant in recent years.

## 📋 Summary
This project visualized India's gender distribution from 2014 to 2023 using World Bank data. The results highlighted that:

1. India continues to show gender imbalance, with a higher male population.
2. There is an upward trend in population growth for both genders.
3. Such insights are useful for policymakers, health services, and social programs aiming for gender equity.

The project also demonstrates how to:
1. Extract public data from trusted sources
2. Clean and transform it using Python
3. Create effective visualizations to derive meaningful insights
